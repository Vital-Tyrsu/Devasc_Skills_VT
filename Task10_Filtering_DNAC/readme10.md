   - Use your virtual DEVASC machine with internet connectivity.

2. **Python Script Copy:**
   - Copy the provided Python script to your Python execution environment, minding the indentations.

### Task Implementation

3. **Adapt Python Script:**
   - Modify the script to produce the desired output as shown in "OUTPUT TASK 10."
   - Replace all placeholders (XXXXXXXX) with suitable parameters, variables, keys, names, or code.

4. **Execution and Verification:**
   - Run the modified script and verify that it produces the expected output.
   - Ensure that the DNAC API calls work correctly and provide the necessary information.

## Task Troubleshooting

5. **Error Handling:**
